### Method Guessing

----

One of the core features of *remote-method-guesser* is it's ``guess`` action, which allows
to identify valid method signatures on *RMI endpoints* by using a wordlist approach. With
*rmg v3.3.0*, the guessing speed increases up to a factor of ``4`` for plain *TCP* connections
and up to a factor of ``8`` for *TLS* protected *RMI* communication. We take this as an opportunity
to write a more detailed explanation on how we perform method guessing and how we achieved the above
mentioned speedup.

### Why Method Guessing?

----

*Java RMI* is a *remote procedure call* (*RPC*) technology for *Java* and allows a client to invoke
remote methods that are defined on the server side. Knowledge of these exposed methods is an important
part to evaluate the attack surface on an *RMI endpoint*. However, apart from some well known (and in
current *Java* versions, well protected) methods, that are available on (almost) each *RMI endpoint*,
it is usually not possible to obtain the signatures of other methods that may be exposed.

This makes evaluating the security state of *RMI endpoints* difficult, because the analyst has only
a limited view on the actual exposed services. The simplest example could be a method with signature
``String execute(String cmd)``, which is obviously dangerous but hidden during a blackbox assessment.
But not only such obviously dangerous methods are of interest. As [Hans-Martin MÃ¼nch](https://twitter.com/h0ng10) explains in
[this blog post](https://mogwailabs.de/en/blog/2019/03/attacking-java-rmi-services-after-jep-290/), also
harmless looking method signatures can be exploited for deserialization attacks, if the methods
signature is known to the attacker.

Despite *Java RMI* does not expose any *API* calls to obtain the available methods signatures of
an *RMI endpoint*, it is possible to guess valid signatures by using a wordlist approach. The idea is pretty
simple: For each method defined in the wordlist, an *RMI* call with invalid argument types is dispatched and
send to the server. Depending on the server exception, it can be determined whether the corresponding method
exists. More details on the different challenges and pitfalls when implementing this technique can be found
within the next chapters.


### Implementation

----

One challenge of implementing *method guessing* is that *Java RMI* is an object oriented *RPC* mechanism.
Invoking remote methods is done via local objects, that wrap references to a corresponding remote object. 
The class of the local object (usually an interface) needs to match the class (or interface) name on the server
side and needs to contain the remote method definitions. The following code snipped shows a simple
example on how to obtain such a local object that wraps a reference to the remote object that is bound as
``example-server`` within the registry:

```java
Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry(rmiHost);
ExampleInterface stub = (ExampleInterface)registry.lookup("example-server");
```

For the ``lookup`` operation to work, it is required that the ``ExampleInterface`` class is available within
the classpath before the lookup action is performed. Otherwise, *Java* throws a ``ClassNotFoundException`` and the lookup
fails. This design is fine for ordinary *RMI* use cases, as the *RMI* developer can include all required
interfaces into the clients codebase. From a blackbox perspective however, this behavior is an obstacle.


#### The Most Naive Approach

To overcome the obstacle mentioned above and to implement a first approach of *method guessing*, one could
do the following steps:

  1. Perform a ``lookup`` operation on the desired bound name and catch the ``ClassNotFoundException``.
  2. Extract the missing class or interface name from the exception (e.g. ``org.example.ExampleInterface``).
  3. Create the corresponding class or interface dynamically (e.g. by using [Javassist](https://www.javassist.org/)).
  4. Add the desired methods to the dynamically created class or interface.
  5. Invoke the methods and use the server side exceptions to identify valid method signatures.

This approach works fine, but has some drawbacks. The most significant one is that you perform valid *RMI* method calls
that lead to real method invocations on the server side. Even when using dummy arguments (e.g. ``null`` for each
object type argument, ``true`` for each boolean, ``0`` for each numeric, ...) the method call could still cause an
undesired behavior on the server. A simple example could be the method signature ``logError(String msg, boolean verbose)``
that is contained within your wordlist, but actually maps to the method ``logError(String msg, boolean shutdownServer)`` on the
server side (only the *method name*, *return type* and *argument types* are used to distinguish remote methods. Argument
names are not important). Invoking such methods with dummy arguments is still dangerous and it would be better to guess methods
without executing them on the server side.


#### Guessing Without Invoking

The [rmiscout](https://github.com/BishopFox/rmiscout) project was the first one (best to my knowledge) that allowed
guessing of remote method signatures without actually invoking them on the server side. To understand how this works, we should
take a look at the structure of a *Java RMI* call:

![RMI Message Structure](https://tneitzel.eu/73201a92878c0aba7c3419b7403ab604/rmg-method-guessing-01.png)

The first three parts of the call are not that interesting for method guessing:

  * The *OperationType* is always ``0x50``, as this operation type is used for method calls
  * The *ObjID* is obtained during the ``lookup`` operation from the *RMI registry* and is just a
    static identifier for the targeted remote object.
  * The *OperationNumber* is always set to ``-1``, as we call methods by their method hash.
    In earlier *RMI* implementations, methods could also be called by using an *interface hash*
    that was valid for the whole interface and by specifying the desired method as a numeric
    identifier (compare e.g. to [RegistryImpl_Skel.java](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/90c1034cd4077e63afc0aad53191a04699a816ce/src/java.rmi/share/classes/sun/rmi/registry/RegistryImpl_Skel.java)).

The *MethodHash* is used by modern *RMI* servers to identify the remote method that was called by the client. It is calculated
by using the methods signature, which includes the *method name*, *return type* and all *argument types*. When an *RMI server*
encounters an unknown method hash (method is not defined on the server side) it throws a corresponding exception. This behavior
can be checked within the definition of the [UnicastServerRef](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/90c1034cd4077e63afc0aad53191a04699a816ce/src/java.rmi/share/classes/sun/rmi/server/UnicastServerRef.java)
class:

```java
try {
    op = in.readLong(); // obtain method hash from incoming stream
} catch (Exception readEx) {
    throw new UnmarshalException("error unmarshalling call header",
            readEx);
}

[...]

Method method = hashToMethod_Map.get(op);
if (method == null) {
    throw new UnmarshalException("unrecognized method hash: " +
        "method not supported by remote object");
}
```

The second exception can be used to determine invalid remote methods during method guessing. In case of an existing
method call, ``UnicastServerRef`` goes ahead and unmarshals the call arguments by using the methods parameter
types that are obtained using reflection:

```java
Class<?>[] types = method.getParameterTypes();
Object[] params = new Object[types.length];

try {
    unmarshalCustomCallData(in);
    // Unmarshal the parameters
    for (int i = 0; i < types.length; i++) {
        params[i] = unmarshalValue(types[i], in);
    }
```

When using the high-level *Java RMI API*, *Java* automatically computes the method hash and makes sure
that all specified parameters match the expected argument types. The *rmiscout* project uses low level *Java RMI*
calls instead, to manipulate the call arguments. Instead of the expected parameter types, a randomly generated class
is send to the *RMI server* and the servers exception is inspected:

  * When the remote method does not exist on the *RMI* endpoint, the ``unrecognized method hash`` exception is thrown as usual.
  * When the remote method does exist, the *RMI endpoint* attempts to unmarshal the call arguments but cannot find the randomly
    generated class within the servers class path. This aborts the actual method call and leads to a different exception that
    indicates the existence of the remote method. As the method call gets aborted, there is no real method invocation on the server
    side. One exception are argument less methods (e.g. ``String getVersion()``), where you can't specify invalid argument types. 


#### Making it Fast

Before *rmg v3.3.0* we basically used the same approach as the *rmiscout* project. Instead of randomly generated classes,
we used a *type confusion approach* (sending object types when the server expects a primitive argument and the other way around),
but this is only a minor difference. In the current version however, we changed the implementation to achieve a noticeable
speedup. To understand how this works, we need again to take a look at the internal structure and the server-side processing of *RMI messages*.

*Java RMI* allows reuse of already existing *TCP connections*. After invoking a remote method once, subsequent remote method
invocations may use the same *TCP channel* and do not have to establish a new connection. This behavior is handled by *Java RMI*
automatically and does not require manual control by the developer. However, reusing *TCP streams* is only possible if they are in a
non corrupted state, which is usually not the case for method guessing.

Internally, *Java RMI* uses the ``invoke`` method from the [UnicastRef](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.rmi/share/classes/sun/rmi/server/UnicastRef.java) class
to invoke remote methods on the client side. This is also the call that the *rmiscout* project and (in earlier versions)
*remote-method-guesser* used. The problem with this method is that it sends the above visualized *RMI* message at once, without
handling intermediate exceptions. The following diagram tries to visualize that behavior when calling an non existing remote method:

![RMI Message Structure](https://tneitzel.eu/73201a92878c0aba7c3419b7403ab604/rmg-method-guessing-02.png)

As one can see, this behavior causes the *MethodArguments* to stay within the *TCP stream*, which makes the stream corrupted
and not reusable. This behavior can also be observed in a comment within the ``invoke`` method of the [UnicastRef](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.rmi/share/classes/sun/rmi/server/UnicastRef.java) class.

```java
public void invoke(RemoteCall call) throws Exception {
  try {
      clientRefLog.log(Log.VERBOSE, "execute call");

      call.executeCall();

  } catch (RemoteException e) {
      /*
       * Call did not complete; connection can't be reused.
       */
      clientRefLog.log(Log.BRIEF, "exception: ", e);
      free(call, false);
      throw e;
```

Not reusing existing *TCP streams* slows down the overall speed of method guessing, as a *TCP connection* needs to be reestablished for each
method candidate in the wordlist. For plain *TCP* connections the impact is not that big of a deal, although it increases with a larger wordlist size.
For *TLS* protected connections however, the slowdown is more significant and we observed speedups up to a factor of ``8`` when implementing reusable streams.


#### Preventing Stream Corruption

The open question is now how to prevent stream corruption during method guessing. From our perspective there are two approaches to do that:

  1. *Argument less guessing* - When looking at the *RMI* message structure displayed above and the behavior how *RMI endpoints* parse
     the corresponding data, it seems that one can just skip sending the method arguments during method guessing. In case of non existing
     remote methods this is indeed fine, as the *RMI endpoint* will only parse the data up to the method hash and then throw an exception.
     When no arguments were sent, the *TCP* streams stays clean and can be reused.

     In case of existing methods, however, *argument less guessing* causes a problem: After obtaining a reference to the desired remote method
     by using the transmitted method hash, the *RMI endpoint* waits for the method arguments to appear on the *TCP* stream. When not sending any
     arguments, this will cause a timeout. Obviously, this timeout would be sufficient as an indicator that the corresponding method exists, but
     such time based approaches are not that reliable, error prone and usually slower.

  2. *Polyglot argument* - In the case of non existing remote methods, method arguments corrupt the *TCP* stream, as they are not read by the server
     during the method call and are interpreted as the start of a new *RMI call* instead. As the method arguments do not form a valid *RMI message*,
     this causes an exception on the server side and the corresponding *TCP* stream is closed by the server. However, if it is possible to send method
     arguments that form a valid *RMI call* on their own, stream corruption could be prevented and the *TCP* connection could be reused.

     In the case of existing methods, on the other hand, the corresponding method arguments need to invalidate the current *RMI call* to prevent the
     method from actually being invoked on the server side.

In *rmg v3.3.0*, we implemented the second approach and looked for a corresponding *polyglot* method argument. Luckily, such a *polyglot* was
surprisingly simple to find.

*RMI messages* usually start with a *TransportConstant* as it was explained earlier. During method calls, this transport constant is always set to
``0x50``, but also other *TransportConstants* exist. In case of other *TransportConstants*, the structure of an *RMI message* differs from the above mentioned
structure and it is parsed differently by the server. The following snipped shows an excerpt of the [TCPTransport](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.rmi/share/classes/sun/rmi/transport/tcp/TCPTransport.java) class, that handles the different
message types:

```java
do {
    int op = in.read();     // transport op
    [...]

    switch (op) {

      case TransportConstants.Call:
          // service incoming RMI call
          RemoteCall call = new StreamRemoteCall(conn);
          if (serviceCall(call) == false)
              return;
          break;

      case TransportConstants.Ping:
          // send ack for ping
          DataOutputStream out =
              new DataOutputStream(conn.getOutputStream());
          out.writeByte(TransportConstants.PingAck);
          conn.releaseOutputStream();
          break;

      case TransportConstants.DGCAck:
          DGCAckHandler.received(UID.read(in));
          break;

      default:
          throw new IOException("unknown transport op " + op);
    }

} while (persistent);
```

Notice that in case of the *TransportConstant* being *Ping* (``0x52``), no further data is read from the input stream.
Therefore, an *RMI Ping* message just consists out of the *TransportConstant* and represents a valid *RMI call* on it's own.
This makes the *RMI Ping* message an optimal candidate for a *polyglot* argument and the following diagram shows how it can
be used during method guessing:

![RMI Ping Polyglot](https://tneitzel.eu/73201a92878c0aba7c3419b7403ab604/rmg-method-guessing-03.png)

With an *RMI Ping* message being used as a method argument, the *TCP* streams stays in a clean state and can be reused
for further guessing attempts in case of non existing methods. But how about existing methods? The *RMI Ping TransportConstant*
is just an ``int``. Doesn't this cause problems with methods that expected an ``int`` as argument? Luckily, the answer is *no*.
But you have to write the data to the correct output stream.

Almost all data written during an *RMI call* is wrapped within an ``ObjectOutputStream`` (only the *TransportConstant* is written
to the raw ``OutputStream`` directly). Within an ``ObjectOuputStream``, data is aligned to match a specific format. This is not only
true for non primitive data (e.g. objects or classes), but also primitive types are aligned within a special data structure.
The following listing shows an example of this situation, where the contents of an *RMI call* are visualized by using the tool
[SerializationDumper](https://github.com/NickstaDB/SerializationDumper). Notice, that the *TransportConstant* (``0x50``) was stripped
before and only primitive method arguments were used during the call. Furthermore, the output of the tool was modified a little bit to
show the different components of the method call:

                         00000001 // Method Argument: (int)1
    --------------------------------------------------------
```

Instead of raw bytes, the *ObjID*, *OperationNumber* and the *MethodHash* are wrapped into a ``TC_BLOCKDATA`` element,
that includes the length of the contained data. If we just write the *RMI Ping TransportConstant* to the ``ObjectOutputStream``
too, it would also be contained within the ``TC_BLOCKDATA`` structure and treated as a regular method argument. Therefore,
during method guessing, we write the *RMI Ping* message not on the ``ObjectOutputStream``, but on the underlying raw ``OutputStream``.
The *RMI Ping* message is then not treated as part of the ``TC_BLOCKDATA`` structure, but as a new element within the
``ObjectOutputStream``. Since the code ``0x52`` (*RMI Ping TransportConstant*) is not a valid element type within ``ObjectOutputStream``,
parsing the corresponding ``ObjectInputStream`` now leads to an error:

```

                 67e2a9311d3dd3ec // Method Hash
    --------------------------------------------------------
  Invalid content element type 0x52
```

This is exactly the behavior we want during method guessing. As the ``ObjectInputStream`` is valid up to the method hash and
the *RMI endpoint* successfully parses all the elements before the *RMI Ping* message. When attempting to read the method arguments
however, the *RMI endpoint* will read the next element (``0x52``) and the underlying ``ObjectInputStream`` throws an exception. Due
to the different exception message, we know that the method exists and because the *RMI Ping* message was read and removed from the
*TCP stream*, the stream stays clean and can be reused. Furthermore, the corresponding remote method was never really invoked, as there
was an error when unmarshalling the method arguments.


#### The Full Story

The chapter above basically explains how method guessing is implemented in *rmg v3.3.0*. However, there is another minor optimization
that is explained in this chapter. When we initially researched for a way to prevent stream corruption, we noticed that pure primitive
method arguments never corrupt the *TCP stream*. This is most likely related to how the ``ObjectInputStream`` class reads ``TC_BLOCKDATA``
structures from the stream.

When a method only expects primitive argument types, the whole argument data is contained within the same ``TC_BLOCKDATA`` structure
that already contains the *ObjID*, the *OperationNumber* and the *MethodHash*. As the length of the ``TC_BLOCKDATA`` content is contained
within the structure itself, ``ObjectInputStream`` parses the whole structure at once and removes it completely from the *TCP* stream.
Even in case of a non existing method hash, the *stream* stays clean as the method arguments were read and removed from the *TCP stream*.
This makes pure primitive method arguments another great candidate for fast method guessing. That being said, there is a problem concerning
real method invocations on the server side.

A major goal of method guessing was to prevent valid method calls on the server side and we already saw that this is implemented by tampering
with the type of method arguments. When enforcing method arguments to be pure primitive (to prevent stream corruption) it is no longer
possible to tamper with the argument types in a way that leads to server side exceptions. As demonstrated above, primitive arguments are written
as raw bytes within a ``TC_BLOCKDATA`` element. Therefore, if the remote method expects e.g. a ``short`` value as argument and a ``long`` is
transmitted, the method will just take the first two bytes of the ``long`` and parse them as ``short``. On the other hand, if the method
expects a ``long``, but a ``short`` is transmitted, the method will wait for the remaining data, which causes a timeout.

Therefore, the technique mentioned above can only be used for methods that accept at least one non primitive argument type. In this case,
the *RMI endpoint* expects the ``TC_BLOCKDATA`` structure to have a specific length and to be followed by another ``ObjectInput`` structure.
We can just append data to the ``TC_BLOCKDATA`` structure, which makes it longer than expected and causes an [OptionalDataException](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/OptionalDataException.html)
on the server side. Looking at the documentation of ``OptionalDataException`` you can find a description that matches exactly the above
described case:

> Exception indicating the failure of an object read operation due to unread primitive data...

But it is even worth the effort to implement a separate guessing approach for methods that take at least one non primitive arguments?
Well, it is difficult to estimate. The approach mentioned above requires usually to send more data to the *RMI server*, as you need
to supply as many primitive arguments as it takes to reach the first non primitive one. The polyglot approach, on the other hand,
causes one additional processing loop on the *RMI server*. In our tests, combining the two approaches was the fastest implementation,
although the speedup was just marginal.

Summarized: *rmg v3.3.0* implements the hybrid approach. Pure primitive methods are guessed by using the *Ping polyglot* technique, whereas methods
with at least one non primitive argument type are guessed by extending the ``TC_BLOCKDATA`` structure over it's expected length. The corresponding
implementation can be found in the [MethodCandidate](https://github.com/qtc-de/remote-method-guesser/blob/develop/src/eu.tneitzel.rmg/internal/MethodCandidate.java)
class within the ``sendArguments`` method.


### About Threading

----

*Java RMI* uses threading by default and creates a separate thread for each connection on the server side. If an *RMI client* invokes the same *remote method* multiple
times simultaneously, these method invocations are executed in parallel on the server side. This behavior is independent of whether the method invocations originate from
the same or different clients. Making *remote objects* thread safe is the responsibility of the developer.

For method guessing, the multi threaded behavior of *Java RMI* is nice and we may be able to speedup the ``guess`` action by using multiple
threads. Initially we thought that one has to create separate [TCPEndpoint](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.rmi/share/classes/sun/rmi/transport/tcp/TCPEndpoint.java)
objects on the client side to profit from multiple threads, but this is not true. A ``TCPEndpoint`` object just saves the remote host,
port and the ``RMIClientSocketFactory`` that should be used to establish connections. Therefore, a ``TCPEndpoint`` is not bound to exactly one
*TCP connection*, as we expected earlier, but is used as a socket factory instead.

When an *RMI client* dispatches a call, it calls the ``newConnection`` method from the [TCPChannel](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.rmi/share/classes/sun/rmi/transport/tcp/TCPChannel.java)
class. This function checks whether there is already a free and reusable connection and creates a new one if this is not the case.
The connection is then used to perform the *RMI call* and is freed afterwards. If no exception occurred, the connection is marked as
*reusable* before it is freed, which causes the connection to be cached for later calls. If another call is dispatched (within
the cache interval for *RMI connections*) the *RMI client* will find the cached connection and reuse it for the call. This is closely related
to the *stream corruption prevention* discussed above, as *stream corruptions* make a stream *not reusable*.

The behavior described above is also true for multiple threads operating on the same ``RemoteObject``. When two threads call a method on
the same ``RemoteObject`` in parallel, they will both use a separate *TCP connection* and create new threads on the server side. If the
corresponding method calls don't cause the connections to be in a corrupted state, they will be cached and reused for later calls that are
requested within the caching interval. This makes the implementation of multi threaded guessing easy, as the *RMI runtime* handles most of
the complicated stuff.

To get an optimal distribution of tasks that is independent of the number of *bound names*, *rmg v3.3.0* divides the method candidates obtained
from the wordlists into as many parts as threads are available. For each *bound name* - *wordlist part* combination, one task is created and executed
within a thread pool. Or, to put it another way: *rmg v3.3.0* distributes guessing in ``n * t`` tasks, where ``n`` is the number of *bound names*
and ``t`` is the number of available threads. These tasks are executed in a thread pool with ``t`` worker threads.


### Conclusion

----

*remote-method-guesser* accesses low level *Java RMI functions* by using reflection, to tamper with *RMI data* before it is send
to the server side. The current method guessing implementation abuses certain properties of the general *RMI message structure*
to achieve a noticeable speedup during the ``guess`` operation. As the *RMI message structure* is usually shared among different
*RMI* implementations, the approach should work in most cases and was tested against different targets (*Java8*, *Java9*, *Java11*,
*Sun Implementation*, *JMX*). If you encounter unexpected errors, please report them by creating corresponding issues in this
repository. Running the most recent older version (*rmg v3.2.0*) can be useful to confirm whether the error is caused by the
new guessing approach. Older implementations of method guessing are no longer supported in *rmg v3.3.0*, but we may reintroduce
them if we notice that they are required.
